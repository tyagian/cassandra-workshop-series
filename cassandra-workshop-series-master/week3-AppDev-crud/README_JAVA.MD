`Cassandra Workshop Series` are an interactive experiences. Advocates share some knowledge about  Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢ database and you can interact with them through chats *([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAIQY251avaMv7bBv5PCo-A) and [discord](https://discord.com/widget?id=685554030159593522&theme=dark))*, quizzes (menti.com), and  exercises.

# Table of Content
For simplicity all exercises instructions are listed in a single `README.MD` document. As it is quite long we provide you a table of content is provided and after each chapter you can go back to it.

## 1. Bootstrapping

There are 2 ways to do the exercises, **locally** on your computer and with a **cloud-based IDE named Gitpod.** We recommend you to use your laptop in order to save code modifications and come back later. In both cases you should start by cloning the repository and download everything (including slides).

- ### Option A - Work with a 100% Cloud-based Environment ‚òÅÔ∏è

**‚úÖ Open gitpod** : [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is an IDE 100% online based on Eclipse Theia. To initialize your environment simply click on the button below.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/DataStax-Academy//cassandra-workshop-series)

A new tab opens in your browser at  `https://<your_uid>.<your_region>.gitpod.io/#/workspace//cassandra-workshop-series`. Those URL are dynamic and we cannot provide clickable links in advance. You should copy-paste `<your_uid>.<your_region>` as we will insert them in each URL  during the exercises.

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**
![TODO](#)

**That's it.** Gitpod provides all tools we will need for today including `Maven` and exporting port `8080`. At initialization of the workspace we schedule a `mvn clean install` to download dependencies. You can still download the repository and bookmark it as all materials including slides are part of it.

- ### Option B - Work with Local Environment üíª

This part is dedicated to people will to run the exercises on their laptop. You can skip it and directly go to [2. Run the Todo Application](#2-run-the-todo-application) if you want to work with gitpod.

**‚úÖ Clone the repository :** : With `git` or through the web UI clone the repo
```bash
# Clone the current repository
git clone https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-series.git

# Access the proper folder
cd microservices-java-workshop-online
```

**‚úÖ Install Docker Compose** (=not for today, to run Cassandra Locally)

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses YAML files to configure the application's services and performs the creation and start-up process of all the containers with a single command. The `docker-compose` CLI utility allows users to run commands on multiple containers at once, for example, building images, scaling containers, running containers that were stopped, and more. Please refer to [Reference Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) if you have for more detailed instructions.

- ![Windows](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/kubernetes-workshop-online/blob/master/4-materials/images/windows32.png?raw=true) : Already **included** in the previous package *Docker for Windows*

- ![osx](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/kubernetes-workshop-online/blob/master/4-materials/images/mac32.png?raw=true) : Already **included** in the previous package *Docker for Mac*

```bash
# Download deliverable and move to target location
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Allow execution
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

## 2. Run the Todo Application

**TodoMVC** is a fabulous community contribution that helps developers compare frameworks on the basis of actual project code, not just claims and anecdotes. Michael Mahemoff. TodoMVC is an immensely valuable attempt at a difficult problem - providing a structured way of comparing JS libraries and frameworks.

![TodoMVC](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/todomvc.png?raw=true)

**‚úÖ Test todoMVC application** : Access the [http://todomvc.com/](http://todomvc.com/) website and test one application with the framework of your choice.

**Todo-Backend** is a shared example to showcase backend tech stacks. The Todo-Backend project defines a simple web API spec - for managing a todo list. Contributors implement that spec using various tech stacks. Those implementations are cataloged below. A spec runner verifies that each contribution implements the exact same API, by running an automated test suite which defines the API.

![TodoBackend](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/todobackend.png?raw=true)

There are multiple free implementations available already. Some implementations provide endpoints to be tested in `heroku`. [Heroku provide free hosting for a Java application but this is on-demand](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-spring-boot-apps-to-heroku). With `Heroku` The application will be sleeping until you access the endpoint. So it will take 30s for the first person to have the application running. Among the available free endpoints we can list:
- `Endpoint#1` : [https://todo-back-springboot220-java12.herokuapp.com/todos](https://todo-back-springboot220-java12.herokuapp.com/todos)
- `Endpoint#2` : [https://todo-quarkus.herokuapp.com/todos](https://todo-quarkus.herokuapp.com/todos)
- `Endpoint#3` : [https://todo-backend-micronaut.herokuapp.com/todos](https://todo-backend-micronaut.herokuapp.com/todos)

**‚úÖ Test TodoBackEnd Spec Runner** : Locate the [spec runner](https://www.todobackend.com/specs/index.html) and use one of the `endpoints` listed below to evaluate if API matchs the requirements. To do so copy-paste one URL and click `Run Tests`.

![TodoBackendTest](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/todobackend-runtest.png?raw=true)

![TodoBackendOuput](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/todobackend-output-host.png?raw=true)

**Note:** *During the live stream you will be hundreds testing the same endpoints so - maybe - we could hit some issues = race conditions.*

**‚úÖ Test TodoBackEnd Web Client** : todoBackend.com provides a [client](https://www.todobackend.com/client/index.html) to work with the API. As before pick one of the `endpoints` listed before and try the client.

![TodoBackendClient](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/todobackend-runclient.png?raw=true)

![TodoBackendClient](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/todobackend-output-client.png?raw=true)

Our mission withing the next hour is to implement the *backend API* and store  data into Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢. We have you covered by providing the skeleton of the application.

**‚úÖ Start Backend API** : By using a maven command or run application in your IDE

```bash
# Build the project without tests (you did not implemented them yet TDD baby !)
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

# Navigate to the proper folder
cd wkshop-microservice-2-spring-boot/

# Start the backend API
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**
```bash

## 3. Create your Astra instance

Access to `ASTRA` service on url [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.datastax.com/)

**‚úÖ  Register (if needed) and Sign In to Astra**

- Access [Registration Page](https://astra.datastax.com/register)
![TodoBackendClient](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/backend-ok.png?raw=true)

### Fill the Create New Database Form

As you don't have have any instances the login will route through the instance creation form. You will find below which values to enter for each field.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-online/master/images/03.png" height="400" />


- **Set the Compute Size**: For the work we are doing please use `Free tier`. You instance will be there forever, free of charge

- **Select the region**: This is the region where your database will reside physically (choose one close to you or your users). For people in EMEA please use `europe-west-1` idea here is to reduce latency.

- **Fill in the database name** - `killrvideocluster.` While Astra allows you to fill in these fields with values of your own choosing, please follow our reccomendations to make the rest of the exercises easier to follow. If you don't, you are on your own! :)

- **Fill in the keyspace name** - `killrvideo`. It's really important that you use the name killrvideo (with no 'e' in "killr") here in order for all the exercises to work well. We realize you want to be creative, but please just roll with this one today.

- **Fill in the Database User name** - `KVUser`. Note the user name is case-sensitive. Please use the case we suggest here.

- **Fill in the password** - `KVPassword`. Fill in both the password and the confirmation fields. Note that the password is also case-sensitive. Please use the case we suggest here.

- **Launch the database**. Review all the fields to make sure they are as shown, and click the Launch Database button.


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-online/master/images/04.png" height="300" />


### View your Database and connect

View your database. It may take 2-3 minutes for your database to spin up. You will receive an email at that point. But, go ahead and continue with the rest of the exercise now.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-online/master/images/05.png" height="300" />


Once Database is ready you should see the following home page:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-online/master/images/06.png" height="100" />


Let‚Äôs review the database you have configured. In the box on the top-left side of the window, you can see the database and keyspace name metadata. The box on the top-right describes the size and location of your database. The lower-left box shows your estimated cost. Once Astra initializes the database completely, the lower-right box will have connection details.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-online/master/images/07.png" height="100" />


### Open DataStax Studio

You can click on `Launch Developer Studio` blue button to start the tool. Please enter the credentials you used for Astra instance creation.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-online/master/images/08.png" height="300" />


- **Fill in the Database User name** - `KVUser`. Note the user name is case-sensitive. Please use the case we suggest here.

- **Fill in the password** - `KVPassword`. Fill in both the password and the confirmation fields. Note that the password is also case-sensitive. Please use the case we suggest here.
